Telegesis ETRX357 Zigbee Breakout
================

This is a breakout for the Telegesis ETRX357 Zigbee board.
Can fit the LRS and HR-LRS variants for use with external antennas and an integrated power amplifier. 

WIP - the first (and only) board I assembled so far didn't work, but this may be due to cooking them too much while soldering, rather than any failure in electrical design.
